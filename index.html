	The world is taking its first steps into <b>imperialism</b>, or the colonization of less powerful countries. Modern world powers in Europe, as well as America and Japan, have realized the value of exploiting colonies and protectorates in order to support their rapidly growing, industrial countries. From the perspective of the industrial powers, the outside world is one of opportunity. However, with European monasteries threatening their religion and culture, many Chinese did not view imperialism quite as positively. China was not doing well at the time: there were droughts and famines, the economy had plummeted and the ruling dynasty had fallen under the influence of foreign powers.

		A small sect of Chinese people formed on the Shandong peninsula in northern China. This society, known as the <b>Big Swords Society</b>, was very <b>ethnocentric</b>, meaning that they rejected other cultures. This ethnocentricity probably was caused by the monasteries put in place by the Europeans. The <b>Big Swords Society</b> gained influence when a local official called upon them to fight bandits in the area. After this, the <b>Big Swords Society</b> turned on local Chinese Christians and foreigners, killing dozens and burning a church. 
</br>
</br>This martial art society, and others like it, formed the precedent for the society known by Americans as the Boxers. Originally the Boxers were known as the <b>Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists</b>, but they soon changed their name to the <b>Militia United in Righteousness</b>, to distance themselves from their cultist origins.
</br> The Boxers saw the Chinese Christians and foreigners as an invasion and a threat to their culture that needed to be exterminated.

			The Rebellion truly began when the Chinese ruling power, <b>The Empress-Dowager</b> of the Qing dynasty, 
			changed her policy toward the Boxers, issuing edicts defending them. The Boxers assembled and marched 
			on Beijing, burning more churches and oppressing Christians and foreigners along the way. The foreigners 
			called for their respective countries to defend them. An allied force of 435 <b>French, Russian, British, American, 
			German, Italian, Japanese and Austrian</b> soldiers amassed in Beijing to defend their monasteries. The Boxers, joined by 
			the Chinese army and some Muslim rebels, blocked the railroad lines to Beijing to cut off further reinforcements.
</br>
</br> On June 11th, 1900, the first Boxer was seen inside the walls of Beijing by 
German Minister Clemens von Ketteler. The Boxer, a young boy, was executed without
 having shown any aggression other than being associated with the Boxers. The Boxers stormed 
 the city in response, overwhelming many of the allied troops, killing thousands.

			<p>
			For eight weeks, the Boxers occupied the city, killing any foreigner they found. Finally, another allied force of American,
			 Japanese, French and German soldiers wiped out the Boxers, murdering anyone even suspected of supporting them. After 
			<b>over 110,000 casualties</b>, the war was over. A fine of $330 million was demanded of the Qing dynasty and any
			 remaining Boxer affiliates in reparation to the foreign powers.

			We believe that this event in history belongs squarely in the <b>Hall of Shame</b>. 
</br>
</br>Most events can be argued to belong in both the Hall of Shame and Hall of Fame, but we believe that the Boxer Rebellion has no redeeming elements. 
The society known as the Boxers was born out of a desperate culture under the oppression of foreign powers. A foreign religion had been thrust upon them, and
 they were surrounded by strange peoples with strange customs. Instead of peacefully protesting to preserve their own cultures and religions, the Boxers struck out
  like a cornered animal, targeting their "invaders". When the military standoff occurred, the first death was a young boy, who had not shown any aggression. The ensuing
  bloodbath alienated China from the rest of the world, pushing them toward an isolation that would last for decades.
