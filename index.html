		The world is taking its first steps into imperialism. Europeans have realized the need of colonies and protectorates in order to support rapidly growing, industrial countries.
			For most of the industrial powers, the view of the outside world is one of opportunity.
			However, with European monasteries threatening their religion and culture, many Chinese people did not view imperialism quite as positively. China was not doing well at the time: There were droughts and famines, the economy had plummeted and the ruling dynasty had fallen under the influence foreign powers.

		A small sect of Chinese people forms on the Shandong peninsula in northern china. Known as the <b>Big Swords Society</b>, this society was very <b>ethnocentric</b>, meaning that they rejected other cultures. This ethnocentricity probably was caused by the monasteries put in place be the Europeans. The <b>Big Swords Society</b> gained influence when a local official called upon them to fight bandits in the area. After this, the <b>Big Swords Society</b> turned on local Chinese Christians and foreigners, burning a church. 
</br></br>
This martial art society, and others like it, formed the precedent for the society known by Americans as the Boxers. Originally the Boxers were known as the <b>Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists</b>, but they soon changed their name to the <b>Militia United in Righteousness</b>, to distance themselves from their cultist origins.
			</br>
		The Boxers saw the Chinese Christians and foreigners as an invasion and a threat to their culture that needed to be exterminated.

			The Rebellion truly began when the <b>Empress-Dowager</b> changed her policy toward the Boxers, issuing edicts that defended them.
 The Boxers assembled and marched on Beijing, burning churches and oppressing Christians and foreigners on the way.
			The foreigners called for their respective countries to defend them. A force of 435 <b>French, Russian, British, U.S., German, Italian, Japanese and Austrian</b> soldiers amassed in Beijing to defend their monasteries. The Boxers, joined by the Chinese army and some Muslim rebels, blocked the railroad lines to Beijing to cut off reinforcements.
</br></br>
On June 11th, 1900, the first Boxer was seen in the walls of Beijing by German Minister Clemens von Ketteler. The boxer, a young boy, was executed without having shown any aggression other than being associated with the Boxers.
The Boxers stormed the city in response, overwhelming many of the troops, killing thousands.

			For eight weeks, the boxers surrounded the city, killing any foreigner, who dared to cross the dead man's land.
			Finally, another allied force of American, Japanese, French and German soldiers wiped out the Boxers, murdering anyone even suspected of supporting them.
			Finally, after <b>over 110,000 casualties</b>, the war was over. $330 million was demanded of the Boxer affiliated sources for reparation to the foreigners.

			We believe that this event in history belongs squarely in the <b>Hall of Shame</b>. </br></br>
			Most events can be argued to belong in either, but we believe that the Boxer Rebellion has no elements to redeem itself. 
			The society known as the Boxers was born out of a desperate culture under the oppression of foreign powers. A foreign 
			religion had been thrust upon them, and they were surrounded by strange peoples with strange customs. Instead of peacefully 
			protesting to preserve their religions, the Boxers struck out, targeting their "invaders". When the military standoff occurred, the first 
			death was a young boy, who had not shown aggression. The ensuing bloodbath alienated China from the rest of the world, urging them toward <b>isolationism</b>.
